                p Exposures and their evaluation are made and documented in the form of a soil test report and geotechnical design according to the rules set out in EUROCODE to be applied mandatorily as from January 1, 2011. Upon request from Customer, designer`s opinions, design checking and expertise are also performed.

                h2 Geotechnical design - Road engineering

                p It is the field where our company has the major part of references. Since the time our company was founded we have been involved in geotechnical designing related to the construction and upgrading of a number of motorways, expressways, bypass roads and local governmental roads.
                p Major geotechnical tasks related to road engineering include but not are limited to, as follows:
                ul
                    li To map sorts of ground in the vicinity of possible routes, including sampling
                    li To select the best vertical and horizontal alignment for each route
                    li To design embankment foundations (use of geoplastics, deep mixing, dynamic ground wedging, soil exchange, etc.), to determine specifications for earthwork material, and to design anti-freeze and improving courses
                    li For high embankments, to perform slope stability tests, consolidation and subsidence calculations, to design acceleration of consolidation (gravel piling, drainage, etc)
                    li For deep cuts, to perform slope stability tests, to design drainage tasks, stability-improving interventions such as ground nailing, anchorage, protection against erosion, etc. and to design different supporting structures
                    li For embankment widening, to determine requirements specific to widening
                    li Etc.

                h2 Geotechnical design – Engineering structures

                p For most roads, the route crosses certain field objects, roads, railways for which there is no option of an at-grade crossing. In such cases, it is necessary to design underpasses, overpasses, culverts, game passes.
                p The major geotechnical tasks related to the designing of engineering structures include, but are not limited to, as follows:
                ul
                    li to determine foundation for engineering structure according to exposures and dimensions / loads supplied to us
                    li for plain foundation, to calculate foundation depth, foundation body dimensions, and to calculate subsidence of foundation body
                    li for a pile foundation, to select the type, diameter and depth of pile, to calculate ultimate load bearing capacity of piles, the pile subsidence and displacement, taking into account - if necessary - negative skin friction as well
                    li to examine and evaluate test load of piles
                    li to calculate the difference in subsidence between abutments and piers, making a proposal for minimizing the differences in subsidence
                    li to determine backfill construction
                    li when designing an underpass, to determine earth pressure and groundwater pressure
                    li to design working pit containment, drainage
                    li Etc.

                h2 Geotechnical design – Public utility lines

                p The major geotechnical tasks arising in connection with designing public utility lines include, but are not limited to, as follows:
                ul
                    li to determine soils along the public utility routes
                    li to calculate working pit stability, to design working space containment
                    li for a high groundwater level, to design drainage for working pits
                    li for a pipe press-through, to determine geophysical parameters required for designing the pressing operation and to issue geotechnical designs
                    li to determine requirements specific to backfill

                h2 Geotechnical design – Civil engineering

                p Nowadays, due to the dense building-to-land ratio of cities, to the propagation of settlements, and to the high landplot prices, more and more frequently occurs that areas with unfavourable conditions for foundation will be built up. Such unfavourable or hard to build areas require, in many cases, special design tasks. Designing vacant plot buildings experienced in big cities and multi-floor deep garages also bring up a number of geotechnical problems.
                p The major geotechnical tasks related to civil engineering include, but are not limited to, as follows:
                ul
                    li to select the way for foundation, as a function of ground, groundwater conditions, and loads transferred from the building
                    li to design drainage, with special attention to basement and multiple-floor deep garages
                    li to design working space containment
                    li to reveal existing foundation body in the case of additional floor construction onto an existing building, to check increased demand on load bearing capacity, and - if necessary - to reinforce existing foundation bodies
                    li for an additional attached building, to minimize difference in movements between building portions
                    li for industrial facilities, to design foundation for machines, units, taking into account increased stresses and possible dynamic loads
                    li to design foundation for antenna towers, water storage towers, reservoirs.
